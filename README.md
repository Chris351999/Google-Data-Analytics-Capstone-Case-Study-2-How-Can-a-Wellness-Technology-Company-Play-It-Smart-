# Capstone Case Study: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?
## A Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project
## Introduction 

Welcome to the **Bellabeat Data Analysis Capstone Case Study**, a project developed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.

In this case study, I take on the role of a junior data analyst working for **Bellabeat**, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. Under the guidance of Bellabeatâ€™s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer, **UrÅ¡ka SrÅ¡en**, this project explores how smart device usage data can be leveraged to drive meaningful marketing insights and support strategic growth.

The goal of this project is to analyze smart device fitness data to uncover user behavior trends and recommend data-driven marketing strategies that can help Bellabeat become a larger player in the global wellness technology market.

Throughout this analysis, I follow the six steps of the data analysis process:
**Ask â†’ Prepare â†’ Process â†’ Analyze â†’ Share â†’ Act**  
These steps provide a structured framework to guide the case study and deliver actionable insights.

By the end of this project, the findings and recommendations presented here will serve as a **portfolio-ready example** of how data analytics can impact business decisions and growth strategies in the real world.

For this case study, I utilized **R**, including **RStudio** and **R Markdown**, due to its versatility in handling data cleaning, analysis and visualization, as well as its effectiveness in documenting the entire workflow. Throughout the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, I also gained experience with additional tools such as **Spreadsheets**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**, which have further enhanced my data analysis capabilities.
